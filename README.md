# Zodiac-Compatibility-Calculator
Prototype site with two experimental (and comedic!) Zodiac calculators, night modes and jQuery animations.

This was envisioned to be an info page for all the 12 zodiac signs and an astrological calculator. 
The functionality can easily be expanded to fully include all 144 zodiac combinations: I just do not yet have time for an algorithm or large switch statement, so would love some contributions.

Code is not the cleanest it could be - this was done over a year ago and I have not refactored it to reflect my modern-day JS knowledge just yet.

There is a night-mode button in the nav bar, and athe second calculator will return rather unfavourable words no matter what ;)

You'll also see that the two types of calculator are different from a UI perspective - the second on is best in terms of UX and UI, as it incorporates dropdown selects.

The basic code is there for a full astrological calculator.
